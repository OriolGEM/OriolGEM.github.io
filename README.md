# 2024_chir_hiv_rv306_vaginal

In this project, I analyse the microbiome of vaginal samples from RV306. I first analyse the microbiome status of baseline samples, and then analise if there are any significant changes in microbiome abundance and composition after applying the different microbiome regimens. 

This project was set up using a [workflowr][] project.
